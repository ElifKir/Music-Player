# Music-Player
Music Player with JS 

Music player application that I made using HTML, CSS, JS. 

(I made this application with visual studio editor.)

An application consisting of 3 songs.

How to use ?

First of all, you can change the song, forward or rewind the song, or turn the volume down, thanks to the buttons under the photo.

In addition, when the song is finished, it will automatically switch to another song.

To see the song list, you can see the names of the songs, the artist and the minute information of the song by clicking the button with three lines.
